#3️⃣ what's in this first project of mine

**HTML, CSS, JS**

Here there is DOM manipulation, and data maintenance, when you insert data it will be modified, depending on the day you access it.

## Goal:

Here my goal is to show what I've been learning so far and what I've managed to do!

## My next step is to learn how to extract API and the backend.
