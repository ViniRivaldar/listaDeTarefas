## Chores Project
# 3Ô∏è‚É£ what's in this first project of mine

# Overview

Welcome to the Chores project! This is my first project where I've implemented HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application that involves DOM manipulation.

## Features

DOM Manipulation: The project incorporates the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) to enhance user interaction and dynamically update content.


## Goal:

The main objective of this project is to showcase my learning journey and accomplishments. I've implemented fundamental web development technologies and techniques, and this project serves as a testament to my progress.

## Future Plans

My next step in this learning journey is to delve into API integration and backend development. I am excited to expand my skills and explore the backend aspects of web development.

Feel free to explore the project and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Thank you for checking out my work! üòä
